Convert US-centric recipes to UK (WIP)

This is a Chrome extension to scan recipe sites and automatically convert US-specific terms to UK, including:

* Imperial units to metric
* Fahrenheit oven temperatures to Celsius (or gas mask)
* American terms such as 'eggplant'
* Cups and sticks (of butter) to metric, by consulting a built-in dictionary of cup -> gram conversion ratios

It's currently under development, so doesn't work yet. I'm mostly trying to work out the best design to handle the conversions.
